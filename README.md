<p align="justify">This is my summer internship project at a cool and well-known Russian aviation company. The task was to create an application for formation and correlation processing of LFM radar signals with realization of inter-network interaction between separate modules.</p>

<p align="justify">Stages of the task:</p>
<ol>
  <li align="justify">Collaborative development and integration with using Git version control tools.</li>
  <li align="justify">Mathematical modeling of reflected LFM radar signals from point radar targets radar targets with subsequent realization on C++/Qt5.</li>
  <li align="justify">Implementation of a module for the reception of reflections radar signals and their subsequent visualization based on Qt5 framework and Qwt library.</li>
  <li align="justify">Organization of network communication via Ethernet protocol Ethernet between the main modules of the program.</li>
  <li align="justify">Realization of algorithms of coordinated filtering of received radar signals and their visualization in the program interface with provision of possibility of displaying specific values of points on the graph, maximum signal level and side lobe levels of the compressed signal side lobes of the compressed signal.</li>
</ol>
